# Item-Replace-Auto-Crafting

This is a datapack that allows for quick replacement of blocks, torches, and food, with an additional automatic torch crafting feature that lets you quickly craft torches.

## Usage Instructions:

Currently, the automatic torch crafting can be toggled on/off using trigger auto_crafting.torch (default is on). The detection is independent, so players can decide whether to turn it off based on convenience.

Additionally, considering potential conflicts, the quick block replacement will not work with items in the off-hand.
